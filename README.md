# Data Mining - Final Project
Repo for the final Project of Diego Sonaglia and Ibtissam Lachhab for the Data Mining elective in the MSE of Computer Science @ La Sapienza
For this project we were asked to parse and analyze position of buses before and after the lockdown (March to August 2020) in Italy in order to determine the relations between lockdown, traffic, buses usage and their punctuality.
